        <p>I have been out of the workplace for the last four years as I had children and became a Single Mother, throughout this time however I learned a lot. I learned a level of efficiency, time management, organisation and diplomacy that I never could have dreamed of before having children and I thought I had all of these in spades before. I have learned that when something needs to be done, it just gets done and usually as soon as its possible to get it out of the way. I've noticed having small children, that assessing and mitigating potential threats becomes second nature, whether it is from themselves or their environment. But as much as I love my children I also learned that I staying at home with them was not my life’s goal. I have always loved tech and some form of it was always incorporated into my work and life, but my time at home with the kids has shown me that I want to make it my career as I know I can be very good at it.  I am the person my family and friends always come to to fix their computers/phones or to jailbreak their phones, tablets or firesticks. I live across the country from my family and so when I go home every 6 weeks (Covid permitting) I seem to go from family member to family member fixing their issues with technology, and I love it. </p>
        
        <br/>
        
        
        <p> All of my jobs have had some sort of computing in them and I have excellent references. In
        recent years I have had to take time off to have and take care of my children, but last year I
        started making strides to work towards a different career. IT has always interested me in
        particular Software Development and Cybersecurity, ideally I think I'd like to combine the two. I
        have dipped in an out of different languages over the years, Python and Javascript mainly but not
        to a large degree. Last year I settled on Java as I could do it through the eCollege and I would get
        an official certificate with it, which I did in May. In January, I began Digital Skills lvl 6 and have finished with excellent results. After completing the Java Foundations Associate
        Certificate in May I began the Java Associate Developer Certification Course which I am
        currently doing and I have just recieved my certifcate for Cisco Netacad's Cybersecurity Essentials course. I have
        done all this as a Single Mother of two very young children in the middle of a pandemic with my
        support system all the way across the country and until April 2021, no childcare.</p>
        <br/>
        
        
        <p>
        This last year has taught me a lot, it has taught me that when I really want to do something I will
        find a way to do it and that I have the steel determination to do it well. I love problem solving, and creating through programming and
        I am very capable of it. Bríd McDevitt is one of my references, please feel free to contact her as
        I've given the explicit permission necessary for her to act as my reference.</p>
        <br/>
        
        <p>I look forward to hearing more from you.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Kind regards,</p>
       <br/>
